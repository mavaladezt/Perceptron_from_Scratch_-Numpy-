### Perceptron for Banknotes/Checks Authentication 

#### Perceptron<br>
Perceptron is a supervised learning binary classifier.
In order to predict, perceptron first tries to find an hyperplane between the 2 sets of data. If the hyperplane exists the data can be easily classified.

The data was obtained from:<br>
__Dua, D. and Graff, C. (2019). UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication). Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science.__<br>

Abstract: Data were extracted from images that were taken for the evaluation of an authentication procedure for banknotes.<br>

Features:<br> 
 1. variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
 2. skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
 3. curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
 4. entropy of image (continuous)
 5. class (integer)
